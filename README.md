# Pandas-Challenge
Panda Project
Introduction
Analysis was conducted on data obtained for the fantasy game, Heroes of Pymoli.  It is a free game with the ability of players to purchase optional items to enhance game play. The goal of the project is to generate a report that breaks down the purchasing data.

Methods
Data was analyzed by gender, age, and purchasing trends of players. Utilizing pandas and juypter notebook.  

Results
Data analysis concluded over 500 players with nearly 800 purchases in the dataset.  The purchases made are predominately from males.  However, females spend slightly more per average on purchases.  The majority of the purchasers are  between the ages of 15 and 24.  The top spenders make two to three purchases.  Final critic and Oathbreaker are the most popular items purchased.  However, Stormfury Mace is the most profiable item.  

Discussion
Anlaysis of data could have been simplified with the creation of the right variables at the top for reuse in later analysis steps.  The lack of a good variable required extra steps to parse data correctly when needing count of players rather than purchases.  I was able to utilize drop duplicates in some instances to assist.
